## Introduction
For this assignment, no dataset has been provided; instead, we need to build our own. We will use the Michelin Guide website as the primary source to gather information on Michelin-starred restaurants in Italy. The goal is to develop a dedicated search engine for food lovers, enabling users to easily find and rank Michelin-starred restaurants in Italy.
